1.Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2 :

HTTP1
->Ithe usest works on the textual format.
->There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.
->It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages
->It compresses data by itself.

HTTP2
->It works on the binary protocol.
->It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
->It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 
->It uses HPACK for data compression.
->HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1.

2.objects and its internal representation in Javascript :

    Objects are important data types in javascript. 
Objects are different than primitive datatypes (i.e. number, string, boolean, etc.). 
Primitive data types contain one value but Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair.
These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, 
in the context of an object

  Every object has some property associated with some value.
These values can be accessed using these properties associated with them.

var myCar = new Object();

myCar.make = 'Suzuki';

myCar.model = 'Altros';

myCar.year = 1978;

myCar.wheels = 2;
